Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
[EC2] Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports
[EC2] VPC default security groups should not allow inbound or outbound traffic
[EC2] EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
[EC2] EC2 subnets should not automatically assign public IP addresses
[S3] S3 general purpose buckets should require requests to use SSL
[EC2] Amazon EC2 should be configured to use VPC endpoints that are created for the Amazon EC2 service
[ELB] Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
[ELB] Application load balancer should be configured to drop invalid http headers
[S3] S3 general purpose buckets should have block public access settings enabled

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- Edit the EC2 Security Group to remove access from the internet
- Edit the Web-App Security Group to remove access from the internet
- Disable password authentication over SSH on EC2 instances and enable support for key-based authentication instead.
- Remove access to all the mentioned ports reachable from the internet
- Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic by default
- Enable access logging on S3 buckets
- Enable encryption on EBS volumes & ensure encryption by default
- Enable HTTP to HTTPS redirection on ALB
- Enable SSE on S3 buckets
