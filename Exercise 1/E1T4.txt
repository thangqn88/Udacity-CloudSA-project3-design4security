Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The Web App (WebAppSG) has open for two ports: 5000 and 80 with HTTP base communication. It should be configured with 443 port for HTTPS communications with more secure.

# Poor practice 2
The InstanceRole has full access to any s3 bucket instance. Against least privilege principle
=> Roles should be specific to the list of resources and actions performed upon them.

# Other poors practice found
- The InstanceRole (IAM Role) is assigned to both RecipeWebServiceInstance instance and AttackInstance
- The Security group is not safe, it's too open, allowing all traffic from any port for different methods of connection.
