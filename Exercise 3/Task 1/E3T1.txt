# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
Sadly, AWS GuardDuty could not detect the brute force attack after trying for a whole day.
I have captured my evidences in the 3 images: 
- E3T1_guardduty.png 
- EC2_AttackInstance.png => It showed the AttackInstance was running.
- EC2_WebServiceInstance.png => It showed the WebServiceInstance was running.
- RunningScriptToAttack.png => It showed the script was running

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

## How GuarDuty can detect this attack?
Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following data sources like: 
- VPC Flow Logs
- AWS CloudTrail event logs
- and DNS logs
In this case, VPC Flow Logs would show the attack attempts.
