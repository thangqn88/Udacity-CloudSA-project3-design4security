# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Web application firewalls (WAF) should be set up to block or log suspicious traffic.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No. This will keep access insure but this will keep the traffic between different services in VPC and S3 within AWS network ( probable bandwidth cost saving ). 
Due to the default policy of gateway endpoint allows access by any user or service within the VPC to any Amazon S3 resource.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Enabling default encryption doesn't change the encryption of objects that are already in the bucket.
Existing objects do not get affected by encryption, only new objects do.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All the changes we made through the AWS management console would be reset.
